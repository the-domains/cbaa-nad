**National Aggregate Database Launched! **

CBAA is proud to announce the launch of the National Aggregate Database (NAD), the next phase in Partners in Safety. The database has been created specifically to address CAR 604 SMS, QA and Review of SMS requirements. On-Board Data Systems and Compliance hosts the NAD on a customized system created to be user friendly and useful for operations of all sizes. 

**What is the CBAA Partners in Safety Program? **

Partners in Safety is a three-part program designed to ensure that our members have access to all the right tools to comply with current safety regulations that is practical, cost-effective and scalable to operations of all sizes. 

1\. CBAA Member SMS, including templates and guidance materials, that are fully compliant with the 604 regulations and have been vetted by Transport Canada (Please click the link at the bottom of this page for the info sheet). 

2\. The National Aggregate Database for reports on aviation hazard and risk information that enable and facilitate compliance (please click on the link at the bottom of this page for the info sheet). 

3\. Flight Data Analysis, a valuable source of data that is an integral part of a functional SMS, to be released later in 2015\. Partners in Safety is part of the CBAA's ongoing commitment to ensure that Canadian business aviation is recognized by Transport Canada and the world as a model sector for safety initiatives and best practices. CBAA thanks our program sponsors, Bombardier Business Aviation and Nav Canada, whose support has allowed us to keep costs to members low.
